\chapter{Environment}
This chapter will explain how to set up and start a bot with the StarCraft environment using a multi-agent system in the GOAL language.

\section{Installation}
For the latest installation instructions, please see: \\ \url{https://github.com/eishub/StarCraft/wiki/Install-Guide}

\section{Chaoslauncher}
In order to make use of all the StarCraft Brood War plugins, you can make use of the Chaoslauncher application. With this application, several plugins can be used like the \textit{BWAPI Injector} which is necessary for using the BWAPI library. It is also recommended to make use of the \textit{APMAlert} plugin, which shows the current actions per minute of all your units together. When the APM of your bot is suddenly very high, your agents might be executing too many actions in a row. It is also recommended to make use of the \textit{W-Mode} plugin. This plugin automatically starts your StarCraft game in windowed mode which is easier for debugging. Yu can also make use of the \textit{ChaosPlugin} to make use of its autoreplay function which automatically saves a replay at the end of each game. You can play these replays by first turning off the \textit{BWAPI Injector}. You can then start StarCraft (in the launcher) and select \textit{Single Player} with gametype \textit{Expansion}. Press the `Ok' button and then the `Load Replay' button. If you then open the
\texttt{Autoreplay} directory in that screen you should be able to see all the replays which are saved by the autoreplay function.

\section{Init Parameters}
\label{mas2g}
The StarCraft environment offers multiple configurable items through the init parametres of a mas2g file. When updating any parameters, do not forget to close the Chaoslauncher before launching a new game, as otherwise your changes will not be applied. The example below demonstrates all parameters and their defaults.

\begin{verbatim}
    use "connector.jar" as environment with
        own_race="",
        enemy_race="random",
        map="",
        starcraft_location="C:\\StarCraft",
        auto_menu="SINGLE_PLAYER",
        game_type="MELEE",
        game_speed=50.
        debug="false",
        draw_mapinfo="false",
        draw_unitinfo="false",
        invulnernable="false",
        map_agent="true",
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Own Race}
\label{own race}
You have to specify the race of your bot. This will make sure that the Chaoslauncher will automatically launch a game with the specified race. You can do this by inserting the following line: \textit{own\_race = <RaceName>}, where \textit{<RaceName>} can either be \textit{zerg}, \textit{protoss}, \textit{terran} or \textit{random}. The option \textit{random} will choose one race with a 1/3 chance for each race.

\subsection{Enemy Race}
\label{enemy race}
The enemy race parameter can be used for specifying which race of the game's built-in AI you want to play against. To this end, you can insert \textit{enemy\_race=<RaceName>}, where \textit{<RaceName>} can either be \textit{zerg}, \textit{protoss}, \textit{terran}, \textit{random}, \textit{randomtp}, \textit{randomtz}, or \textit{randompz}. The option \textit{random} will choose a race with a 1/3 chance for each race, whilst the other options will choose one of the two indicates races with a 1/2 chance for each race.

\subsection{Map}
\label{map}
You have to specify which map the Chaoslauncher will automatically load when starting the game. This can be done by inserting the following line: \textit{map = <filename>}, where \textit{<filename>} is the exact filename of the map (with extension). Please note that the environment only supports maps in the directory \textit{StarCraft/maps}, and that subdirectories (like \textit{sscait}) should be indicated. Also note that the first time the environment runs on a certain map, it will take some time (around 2 minutes) to generate a datafile for the given map (if not already present in \textit{StarCraft/AI/BWTA}).

\subsection{StarCraft Location}
\label{StarCraft location}
You have to specify the location of the StarCraft game if it is not installed in \textit{C:\\Starcraft}. Using this location, the Chaoslauncher will automatically start when launching a MAS. When the Chaoslauncher is already running, it will not start again until you close it, but this is fine as long as you use the same init parameters (although you have to start the next game manually then). You can specify the location of StarCraft by inserting \textit{StarCraft\_location = <FilePath>}, where \textit{<FilePath>} is the absolute path to the StarCraft installation folder.

\subsection{Auto Menu}
\label{auto menu}
The auto menu parameter is used to automatically go through the menus of the game when starting a MAS. This can be used for single player games and multi player games. To use the auto menu function you can insert the following line: \textit{auto\_menu=<MenuChoice>}, where \textit{<MenuChoice>} can take the following values:\\
\textit{SINGLE\_PLAYER}: for a single player game.\\
\textit{Multi\_PLAYER}: for a multiplayer game.\\
\textit{LAN}: for a local multiplayer game.

\subsection{Game Type}
\label{game type}
The game type is used to indicate what kind of game the Chaoslauncher should start. Generally, you want this to be the default (\textit{MELEE}), but other game types can be used by inserting \textit{game\_type=<GameType>}.

\subsection{Game Speed}
\label{game speed}
The game speed parameter can be used to set the initial speed of the game when the StarCraft game is launched (the speed can be changed during the game by using the development tool; see the next item). StarCraft makes use of a logical frame rate, which means that the game\_speed depends on the amount of frames per second (fps) used to update the game. The higher the fps, the faster the game will go. For using the game\_speed parameter you can insert the following line: \textit{game\_speed=<FPS>}, where \textit{<FPS>}. If a number lower than 1 is given, there will be no limit on the amount of FPS used, and the game will thus run as fast as it possibly can.

\subsection{Debug}
\label{debug}
The environment offers a development tool for debugging purposes. With this development tool, you can increase or decrease the game speed, enable cheats and toggle the drawing of map and/or unit details in the game. More information about the development tool can be found in \ref{development tool}. In order to enable or disable launching the development tool, you can insert \textit{debug=<Boolean>}.

\subsection{Draw Map Info}
\label{draw map info}
This parameter can be used to draw info about the map (bases, regions, chokepoints) without having to enable it the development tool (or without starting the development tool at all) by inserting \textit{draw\_mapinfo=<Boolean>}.

\subsection{Draw Unit Info}
\label{draw unit info}
This parameter can be used to draw info about units (counts, IDs, health, targets) without having to enable it the development tool (or without starting the development tool at all) by inserting \textit{draw\_unitinfo=<Boolean>}.

\subsection{Invulnerable}
\label{invulnerable}
The invulnerable parameter can be used to automatically make your units invulnerable from the start of the game (which can also be done manually in the development tool). This can come in handy for testing purposes when you do not want to fight your opponent. To use the invulnerable function you can insert \textit{invulnerable=<Boolean>}.

\subsection{Map Agent}
\label{map agent}
If enabled, the environment will generate an entity of name and type \textit{`mapAgent'}. This entity is not connected to a unit in the game, but will be the only entity to receive all global information (\textit{base/2, chokepoint/6, enemyrace/1, map/2, region/5, attacking/2, constructionSite/2-3, enemy/9, friendly/3, gameframe/1, mineralField/4, nuke/2, resources/4, underConstruction/5, vepseneGeyser/5, winner/1}), and can even take a few actions (\textit{cancel/1, forfeit/0}). Thus, when the map agent is enabled, all other entities will only receive their own local information (\textit{self/2, status/7, order/3, defensiveMatrix/1, queueSize/1, researching/1, unitLoaded/1}), whilst they can of course still take the same actions. The map agent entity can be enabled or disabled with \textit{map\_agent=<Boolean>}.

\section{Entity Types}
When defining a launch rule it is important that a correct entity type is used. This value has to be the same type of the StarCraft unit without spaces and where the first letter is uncapitalised. So when you for example want to connect an agent to a \texttt{Terran SCV}, this can be done by using the entity type \textit{terranSCV}. Note that each unit type starts with the race of the unit, followed by the exact name of the unit type.

\begin{verbatim}
    define myAgent as agent {
        use MyAgentInit as init module.
        use MyAgent as main module.
        use MyAgentEvent as event module.
    }

    launchpolicy {
        when type = terranSCV launch myAgent.
    }
\end{verbatim}

When using mind control (an advanced Protoss ability), some units from other races can be taken over. These units will also get an entity. An possible way to accomodate such entities is by making sure any other unit type is connected to some generic agent through a wildcard launch rule at the very end of your mas2g: \begin{verbatim}
    while type=* launch ...
\end{verbatim}

\section{The Development Tool}
\label{development tool}
The development tool can be automatically launched by using the \textit{debug} init parameter. It provides several actions that are useful for debugging purposes.

\subsection{Game Speed}
The Game Speed slider can be found at the top of the development tool window. When the slider is used, the speed of the game will be changed immediately. The slider start on a value of 50 fps (this will not reflect the \textit{game\_speed} init parameter). The slowest speed is 20 fps, and from there you can set it as fast as you want. Please note that the agents are supposed to play at 50 fps, which is the default game speed for AI tournaments. When the speed is set to more than 100 fps, the agents can react slower than they would on the tournament speed. Setting the game speed to more than 100 fps should thus only be used for quick testing purposes.

\subsection{Cheat Actions}
The development tool offers 3 buttons which instantly enable StarCraft cheats. Note that these cheats should be used for testing purposes only. The first cheat is called: \textit{Give resources} which gives the player 10000 minerals and 10000 gas. The second cheat is called: \textit{Enemy attacks deal 0 damage} which makes the units of the player immune for damage (note: this can be automatically enabled with the init parameter \textit{invulnerable}). The last cheat is called: \textit{Show map} which makes the whole map visible for the player. Note that  all your agents will then also perceive everything on the map.

\subsection{Draw Actions}
The development tool can also be used to show map or unit details in StarCraft itself. There are 2 buttons to this end, reflecting the matching \textit{draw\_mapinfo} and \textit{draw\_unitinfo} parameters. Please see the information above on these parameters for more information.
